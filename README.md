Sajax
=====

Sajax is a python/jQuery extension for building ajax web applications.

There are a ton of tools/libraries/frameworks out there that make AJAX really easy though, right? Turns out,
there aren't really any that ease the transition between python and javascript specifically. Even jQuery's
added functionality isn't really all that helpful, even when you narrow your focus down to just the javascript
side of things.

A lot of how this was built was inspired from personal experience with an old PHP ajax framework, XAjax.
